A test of network simplex algorithm in MCFClass project.

It shows how to use it to solve minimum cost maximum flow problem.

The project is here:http://www.di.unipi.it/optimize/Software/MCF.html

I added a small amount of code into Main.cpp, so there are Main.cpp in this path. You can find other code in the MCFClass project home page.
